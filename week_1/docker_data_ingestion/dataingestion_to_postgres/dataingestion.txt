In this part we learned how to ingest data in postgres database using python script, cool stuff!!!

1. docker compose file is created (.yaml extension) this file will acts as a reference, wherein we will edit our commands.
which we will fire on command line to create postgres database image.

2. we ran docker command to pull the postgres image

3. LETS BUILD A DATAPIPELINE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. will build a script to ingest data in postgres. The data is ingested in chunks.For simplicity to see how things works, I have
used ipy notebook to run the script. But in production environment we fire .py file from command line.
will try to build a production ready script as we procced the course.
